spec Spec_Unreal

// Unrealizable variant of the Greenhouse specification.
// The justice assumption that soil eventually becomes moist is commented out.
// However, the system is still required to eventually see moist soil,
// creating a conflict that causes unrealizability.

// Environment Variables
env boolean tempHigh;       // temperature exceeds threshold
env boolean soilDry;        // soil moisture is low
env boolean lightLow;       // light is not enough

// System Variables
sys boolean fanOn;          // ventilation fan is turned on
sys boolean waterPumpOn;    // irrigation is active
sys boolean growLightOn;    // artificial lighting is enabled

// Assumptions

// Initial
asm ini !tempHigh;       
asm ini !soilDry;         

// Safety
asm alw !(tempHigh & soilDry & lightLow);  
asm alw (tempHigh -> next(tempHigh | !tempHigh));  

// Justice
asm alwEv !soilDry;     
asm alwEv !lightLow;    

// Guarantees

// Initial
guarantee ini !fanOn;         
guarantee ini !waterPumpOn;   

// Safety
guarantee alw (tempHigh -> fanOn);  
guarantee alw (!tempHigh -> !fanOn);  
guarantee alw (soilDry -> waterPumpOn);  
guarantee alw (lightLow -> growLightOn);  

// Justice (problematic line)
guarantee alwEv !soilDry;  
// <- This line REQUIRES the environment to eventually provide moist soil,
// but we do NOT assume that anymore â€” makes the spec unrealizable.
